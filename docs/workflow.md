# User Workflow

This document describes the typical workflow when using CBZ Master Studio.

### 1. Mode Selection
- **Mode 1**: Best for batches of folders where each folder is a chapter/volume.
- **Mode 2**: Best for folders with thousands of mixed images that need automatic grouping.
- **Mode 3**: Best for converting existing ZIP/RAR archives to comic formats.

### 2. Analysis Phase
- Always click **ANALYZE** first.
- The program will scan the source directory and show a list of items.
- Red rows indicate invalid items (e.g., subfolders in Mode 1).
- Green rows are ready to be processed.

### 3. Selection
- Use the checkboxes in the list to select exactly which items to process.
- Summary at the bottom shows estimated final size and space savings.

### 4. Execution
- Click **EXECUTE** to start the process.
- Monitor the **Activity Log** for real-time progress.
- Once finished, a summary report will appear.

### 5. Cleanup
- Choose how to handle original files:
    - **Move to TO_DELETE**: Safest option, moves originals to a subfolder for manual review.
    - **Recycle Bin**: Sends originals to Windows Recycle Bin.
    - **None**: Keeps originals untouched.
